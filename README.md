# Guess-the-year
We have the dataset containing the list of songs from 1922 to 2011, each with several attributes (essentially the parameters of timbre and covariance) that help to determine the year they were released. 

The task is to predict the smallest year difference between ground truth and prediction by PyTorch, Pandas frameworks
